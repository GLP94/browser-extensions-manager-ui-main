## Tools Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. React

## What Was Learned

* This is the first time using React, and it wasn't so bad to implement it. Difficulties were expected,\
  but I did not mind JSX, as it looked like the string literal with backticks. 
* Also first time implementing Dark-Light mode. There were different ways to go about this, but ultimately\
  I ended up using a CSS in the body, with two selectors that would apply based on the current class of body.\
  I might need to look into the most efficient one.

## What Needs More Work

* I learned how to work with it, but I did not learn how to actually set up a React enviroment. This was a\
  great oversight, and I should look more into this, to be more properly ready to take on another react\
  project;
* On that point, I also tried to learn git commands, but I have not understood them that well. I had to use\
  the desktop Github app to upload the many files of this project;
* There is one moment where on page load a blank screen appears. I think it's the "loading..." paragraph.\
  Not entirely sure how to resolve this issue?
